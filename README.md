👋 Welcome to my User Gender Prediction Project!
==================================================

🔍 This project focuses on predicting user gender based on browser usage patterns, balancing personalization and privacy in the digital world.

💡 I used **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** for data processing and visualization, then trained a **RandomForestClassifier**. The model achieved 78% accuracy, performing well for female predictions but struggling with male predictions due to class imbalance.

📊 Key steps included dataset merging, feature engineering, encoding, and model evaluation. While the results are promising, future improvements are planned to enhance performance.

💻 The project includes a detailed PDF and a `.ipynb` notebook for hands-on exploration.
